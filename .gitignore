# .gitignore for Terraform projects

# Local Terraform state files
# These files contain the state of your managed infrastructure.
# They can contain sensitive data and should not be committed, especially in a team environment.
# Use remote state (like an S3 bucket or Terraform Cloud) instead.
terraform/*.tfstate
terraform/*.tfstate.*.backup

# Crash log
# Automatically generated if Terraform crashes.
terraform/crash.log
terraform/crash.*.log

# Exclude all .tfvars files to avoid committing sensitive data
# It is a best practice to use a terraform.tfvars.example file
# (which is committed to git) to show which variables are needed.
terraform/*.tfvars
terraform/*.tfvars.json

# Local plan files
# These can also contain sensitive data and are for temporary use.
terraform/*.tfplan

# The .terraform directory contains provider plugins and modules.
# This directory is created by 'terraform init' and can be large.
# It should always be regenerated by each user.
terraform/.terraform/

# Override files
# These are meant for local overrides of your configuration and should not be
# shared with the team.
terraform/override.tf
terraform/override.tf.json
terraform/*_override.tf
terraform/*_override.tf.json

# CLI configuration files
# These are user-specific and should not be versioned.
terraform/.terraformrc
terraform/terraform.rc

# Common OS and editor files
